    "  2. there is more than one server at the station (e.g. a fast food stand).\n",
    "- Arrival rates are uniformly distributed independently to time. We would expect that the arrival rates for queues (how busy\n",

    "- People *only* leave the queue once they have been served. We would expect that people could give up on a queue at any time,\n",
    "  decreasing the queue length independently of the server.\n",
    "- We have assumed that the rate of arrivals to a queue is independent of its length. However, we would expect that arrival rates\n",
    "  for longer queues are lower than those for shorter queues.\n",
    "- When we are keeping track of how long individual customers have spent in queues, we additionally need to assume that\n",
