    "We make the following assumptions:\n",

    "  1. multiple people are served at the same time by a single server (e.g. a rollercoaster), or\n",
    "  2. there is more than one server at the station (e.g. a fast food stand).\n",
    "- Arrival rates are uniformly distributed independently to time. We would expect that the arrival rates for queues (how busy\n",
